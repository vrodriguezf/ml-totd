    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I often find myself coding a machine learning experiment in a Jupyter Notebook, and using [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://www.wandb.com/) to visualize and track the results of the runs. When the experiment is drafted, I always have questions such as: How will the performance be affected by the parameter a? What if I change the number of items of the dataset, or change the dataset completely?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperpameter tuning with [wandb sweeps](https://docs.wandb.com/sweeps) are a great tool to solve these questions. However, sweeping requires that you define a specific training program, as a separate python file. I find this to be redundant, specially when the code for training is already in the Jupyter Notebook. Furthermore, if I make some changes in the original notebook, I have to be sure that I change the sweep script too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post shows a trick to execute a Jupyter Notebook as the program of a wandb sweep. This provides a frictionless way of using your Jupyter Notebooks both for single runs and sweep functions. We won't use any separate configuration or script file (unless doing it in Colab), everything will be done between Jupyter and wandb.\n",
    "\n",
    "As use case we will perform a time series classification task with deep neural networks using the wonderful library [tsai](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai).\n",
    " This is all the code needed to train a classifier in `tsai` for the dataset [NATOPS](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=NATOPS): "

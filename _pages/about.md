My name is Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez and I work as an assistant professor in the school of computer systems engineering of  Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM). I got my PhD in computer science at the Autonomous University of Madrid. Currently I am part of the [Applied Intelligence and Data Analysis (AIDA)](http://aida.etsisi.upm.es/) research group at UPM, where I am  involved with several projects funded by the European Commision. My research interests revolve around practical applications of deep learning, with a special emphasis on time series data.
